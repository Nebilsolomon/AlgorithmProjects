I use just one file for all three algorithms. I wrote these algorithms in c++. if you compiled Algorithm.cpp, it will print all three algorithms. First algorithm is encoding text. When word has similar adjacent char, I count them with while loops, and I replace similar adjacent char with their number of count. Second algorithm find a word in long sentence. I use na•ve algorithm to find word. Third one I use bubble sort. All algorithm working well.
